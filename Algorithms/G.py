"""On the previous quiz, you needed to find n-th prime for Vanya. I think it was very easy, so letâ€™s make it a little harder. You need to find a prime whose index is n-th prime. As an example prime numbers is: 2, 3, 5, 7... have indexes 1,2,3,4... so 2 and 3 indexes are primes too, therefore we have sequence of "superprimes" like: 3, 5, 11, 17... Find n-th superprime."""
