#Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment:

#Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line:
#Example
print("Hello, World!") #This is a comment

#Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:
#Example
"""
This is a comment
written in
more than just one line
"""
print("Hello, World!")
